<summary>PR Checklist</summary>

__Please leave this checklist in your PR.__

- Source changes maintain stated browser compatibility.
- Issue being fixed is referenced.
- Unit test coverage added/updated.
- E2E test coverage added/updated.
- Typings added/updated.
- Changes do not break SSR:
  - Careful to test `typeof document/window !== 'undefined'` before using it in code that gets executed on load.
- README updated (API changes, instructions, etc.).
- Changes to dependencies explained.
- Changeset added (run `npm run changeset` locally to add one, and follow the prompts).
  - EXCEPTION: A Changeset is not required if the change does not affect any of the source files that produce the package bundle. For example, demo changes, tooling changes, test updates, or a new dev-only dependency to run tests more efficiently should not have a Changeset since it will not affect package consumers.
