# Contributing

Fork the repo, then clone your fork to your machine and run:

```sh
npm install
```

To test in the browser during development, run:

```sh
npm start
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:9966

> Note that changes to **test** files ([test](./test) HTML and JS) are hot-reloaded, but changes to the [source](src/index.js) **are not**. It would be great if source changes were also hot-reloaded. If you know how to fix that, please do!

## Testing

When you're done with your changes, be sure to run `npm run format` to have Prettier format your code, and use `npm run lint` to check for syntax issues. `npm run test:unit` will run unit tests.

You can also simply run `npm test` to check all of the above.

## API Changes

If you added/removed options in the API, please remember to update the docs in the [README](README.md) as well as the [typings](index.d.ts).

## Changeset

Before posting your PR, please add a changeset by running `npm run changeset` and following the prompts. This will help us quickly make a release with your enhancements.

If your changes don't affect the source or typings, then a changeset is not needed (and you can ignore the bot's automated comment on your PR about not finding one as part of your changes).

## Anything Helps

We want to recognize **all** contributions. To that end, we use the [All Contributors Bot](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage) to automate adding all types of contributions to our [README](README.md).

You can also use the [All Contributors CLI](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/cli/usage) instead of the bot: `npm run all-contributors add <USERNAME> <KEY>[,<KEY>...]` (where `KEY` is an [emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) contribution term). Then run `npm run all-contributors generate` to update the README.

Please feel free to use the bot on your own issue or PR to add yourself as a contributor (or use the CLI), or remind one of the maintainers to do so.
