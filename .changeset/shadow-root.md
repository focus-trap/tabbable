Adds new Shadow DOM support (must be explicitly enabled using the new `getShadowRoot` option).
    - When enabled, supports open shadows by default, and can support closed shadows if the option is a function that returns the shadow for a given node. See documentation for more information.
    - Includes all updates from `5.3.0-beta.0` and `5.3.0-beta.1` releases.
